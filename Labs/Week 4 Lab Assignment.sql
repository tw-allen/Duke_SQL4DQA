-- Instructions --

-- Use the tpch relational dataset to answer the following questions. Write your code in this
-- file after each corresponding question and include a comment with the answer to the question
-- if applicable.  Code should use syntax best practices.  Submit code at end of lab session.



-- About the tpch database --

-- The tpch relational dataset contains data on 1.5 million orders for 'parts'.  The orders table 
-- contains data on each order.  The line item table contains data on the specific parts included
-- in each order.  The customer, nation, part, partsupp, region, and supplier tables all contain
-- additional data that can be related back to the orders and line items. 







-- 1. Return all parts with a below average retail price --






-- 2. Return all customers who have an account balance smaller than the smallest order with status of 'P' in the data base --







-- 3. Return all columns from the customers table as well as a column that categorizes account balances into small, medium, large --
-- and extra large balances.  Extra large balances are considered to be over $8k, large balances are considered to be larger than $6k --
-- and less than or equal to $8k, medium balances are considered to be larger than $3k and less than or equal to $6k, and small orders are --
-- considered to be $3k or less. --





-- 4. Using a sub query return a list of all nations who have a customer with a '988' area code and an account balance of at least $9,500  --

			
		





-- 5. Which customer market segments have a higher total account balance than the automobile and building segments? --







-- 6. Write a query that show percent of total orders for each order priority (results should be on one row) --







-- 7. Write a query that show percent of total order value for each order priority (results should be on one row) --







-- 8. Rewrite your query from #6 so that the data is now at the customer number level  --






-- 9. Join your results from #8 to the customer table (all customers should be in result set) --






-- 10. Rewrite the query from the previous problem but this time use a common table expression --
