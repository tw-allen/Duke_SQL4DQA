-- About the tpch database --

-- The tpch relational dataset contains data on 1.5 million product orders.






-- 1. What are the distinct values of the order priority column in the orders table? --

SELECT distinct

    , MAX(o_orderdate) as "Last Order Date"
FROM
	orders;





-- 3. How Many Orders were placed in 1994? --

SELECT

SELECT

-- 5. How many orders have a total price above $200,000? --

SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	orders
WHERE
	o_totalprice > 200000;




-- 6. What is the average price for orders with order priority of '3-MEDIUM' or higher (priority)?  Use IN in your query. --

SELECT
	AVG(o_totalprice)
FROM
	orders
WHERE
	o_orderpriority IN ("3-MEDIUM", "2-HIGH", "1-URGENT");




-- 7. Using the part table, what is the most expensive part whose name begins with 'p'? --

SELECT
	p_name
	, p_retailprice
FROM

WHERE
	p_name LIKE "p%"
ORDER BY
	2 DESC
LIMIT
	1;




-- 8. Using the part table, what is the least expensive part that has a part type that is not considered small? --

SELECT
	p_name
    , p_retailprice
FROM
	part
WHERE
	p_type NOT LIKE "%small%"
ORDER BY
	2;




-- 9. Write a query that shows count and average price per order status.  Give names to the count and average columns and round the prices to 2 decimal places --

SELECT
	o_orderstatus
	, COUNT(*) AS "Number of orders"
    , ROUND(AVG(o_totalprice), 2) AS "Average price"
FROM
	orders
GROUP BY
	1;




-- 10. In the part table, price per pound is considered to be the retail price divided by the part size.  Which manufacturer has the highest price per pound? --

SELECT
	p_mfgr
	, p_retailprice / p_size AS "Price per pound"
FROM
	part
ORDER BY
	2 DESC;




-- 11. Write a query that shows total orders per order priority category and order status among orders with an order status of 'F' or 'P'.  Order results by order totals descending.  Please use numeric placeholders in your query.  --

SELECT
	o_orderpriority
    , o_orderstatus
    , COUNT(*) AS "Total orders"
FROM
	orders
WHERE
	o_orderstatus IN ("F", "P")
GROUP BY
	1, 2
ORDER BY
	3 DESC;




-- 12. Return the frequency of orders in each month in 1997 that had at least 800 total orders. Please filter to orders whose comment mentions "excuses" --

SELECT
	MONTH(o_orderdate)
